Jenkins
Add a new Kubernetes Container template called jenkins-slave-python (if you've build and pushed the container image locally) and specify this as the node when running builds. If you're using the template attached; the role: jenkins-slave is attached and Jenkins should automatically discover the slave for you. Further instructions can be found here. Python installation commands are slightly modified from the SCL versions, which can be found here.
